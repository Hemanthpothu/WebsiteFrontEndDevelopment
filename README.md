1.Introduction

The website that i'm going to create will be a phone site that involves the selling of phones and other related items such as
sim cards, news about the latest technology etc. There will be a variery of options for the users to choose from however as this is just an initial prototype
there will be restricitons set.


2.Motivation

The motivation behind creating the website was the fact that in this day and age literally everyone of all ages ranging
from school kids to older aged people tend to have a mobile phone. As there is alot of competion ith phone shops and network providers
i thought why not sell the same deals at the slightly better price which would therefore mean that people
would rather choose coming to my site and puchasing the products rather than my competitors.

3a) - Designs Features

Multiple Page Site - The site is made up of multiple pages which means that the the site takes the user to a series of pages when they click on differnt links to browse.

The Navigation bar - The navigation on the site is positioned at the top which is consistent through out. When the user views the site on the desktop version, the navigation bar is in, inline block across, however when the user views the site in the mobile and tablet version, there is a Hamburger menu, bascially it's an image where the user will need to click in enable for the navigation links to show. The change in menu is done through using Javascript

Other Navigation - (Site Map) - There is also a site map at the bottom of all pages so the user may get around the site with ease.

Social media icons - These icons are within the footer at the bottom of the site on all the pages. When the user hovers over these items, an effect is generated to show what icon is being hovered over

6.PARC Design

I have used the four principles that the visual design of a website should include

Proximity: Related items should be grouped close together. This provides the viewer with a visual cue that this items are similar and should be treated as a group.
Alignment: Every visual element on a page should have some kind of connection to at least one other element. Nothing should be positioned haphazardly.
Repetition: Common elements, such as colors, graphics, layout styles, and so on, should be repeated to give a consistent look and feel to a page.
Contrast: The idea of contrast is to make dis-similar elements very different. Contrast is one of the most powerful visual design tools.
